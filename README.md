## How to create the project
* Assembly the circuit as in KiCad schematics
* Upload prj_release.conf configuration to nRF7002 DK using nrf Connect with toolchain v2.5.1
* Pair the device with [https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-border-router#2](Open Thread Border Router)
* Use [https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/matter/chip_tool_guide.html](chip-tool) to test the connection
